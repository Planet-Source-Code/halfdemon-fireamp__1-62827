### Description

FireAMP! is a *simple* media player written in vb6.

features:

* FFT analysis of sound (or simply visualizations) around 14 visualizations

* MP3 tag reading

* Video in player itself, full screen

* Scan disk for media

* save playlists

* Media tracker mode: when minimized, it becomes a small player that always stays on top of any app.

Skinning is not yet perfected. i've included a skin compiler source code and the source code for a skin packager, so compile the dll first.

Great for anyone lookin' for some ideas on writing and using FFT and visualizations.

Comments will be nice!
